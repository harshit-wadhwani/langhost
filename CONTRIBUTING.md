# Contributing to langhost

Thanks for helping keep this **100% open source**.

This monorepo has two packages:

- **`langhost`** — CLI (`langhost serve`)
- **`langgraph-runtime-pg`** — Postgres + Redis runtime (`edition=pg`) that powers the official Agent Server

We replace the *runtime*, not the Agent Server. Prefer stock `langgraph-api` / `langgraph` / SDK behavior.

## Principles

- **Clean-room.** Do not reverse-engineer closed LangChain Docker bytecode. Use public docs, Agent Protocol behavior, and the open `langgraph-runtime-inmem` package as a surface reference.
- **Reuse upstream.** Extend the runtime edition; do not fork the HTTP API.
- **Small PRs.** Focused diffs are easier to review and ship.

## Setup

Requirements: Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Docker, git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/langhost/langhost.git
cd langhost
uv sync --group dev
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
uv run pre-commit install   # optional
```

## Checks and tests

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files

# Full e2e (compose + package tests + live API + upstream SDK suite)
./scripts/test.sh

# Faster loop when Postgres/Redis are already up
uv run pytest -q libs/langgraph-runtime-pg/tests
```

## Making changes

1. Open an issue for larger design work when practical.
2. Match existing style (`ruff` / `mypy` in the root `pyproject.toml`).
3. Add or update tests under `libs/langgraph-runtime-pg/tests/` for behavior changes.
4. Schema changes belong in Alembic revisions under
   `libs/langgraph-runtime-pg/src/langgraph_runtime_pg/migrations/versions/`.

## Pull requests

- Explain **why** the change is needed and how you verified it.
- Do not commit secrets, `.env`, or local `.tests/` checkouts.
- Keep the PR focused — one concern per PR when possible.
- CI must be green (`Lint`, `Build`, `Test`).

## Releasing

Both packages ship in **lockstep** (`langhost` and `langgraph-runtime-pg` share the same version).

1. Bump both package versions in their `pyproject.toml` files (and the `langhost` → `langgraph-runtime-pg==…` pin).
2. Run `uv lock` and `python3 scripts/check_versions.py`.
3. Merge to `main`.
4. Tag and push (tag must match the version, with a `v` prefix):

   ```bash
   git tag v0.11.1.post4
   git push origin v0.11.1.post4
   ```

5. The **Release** workflow builds, publishes both packages to **PyPI** (Trusted Publishing / OIDC), and creates a GitHub Release.

### One-time PyPI + GitHub setup

- Create GitHub Environments **`pypi-langhost`** and **`pypi-runtime`** (Settings → Environments) with **required reviewers** so a human must approve before each upload.
- Pending / trusted publishers (same repo + workflow `release.yml`, different environments):
  - `langhost` → environment `pypi-langhost`
  - `langgraph-runtime-pg` → environment `pypi-runtime`
- Protect `main`: require the **Lint**, **Build**, and **Test** status checks before merge.
- The Release workflow runs the full CI suite first; each package publishes only after CI is green and its environment is approved.
